# BIMsage
BIM-based Multimodel platform for managing existing constructions (prototype).

## Important Notice
Currently, the dependent library responsible for the ICDD-Management does not work. For this reason, BIMsage is not in a functioning state anymore. Since the project will also not be supported in the near future, this repository serves mainly as an archive of the remaining project source code.

To start the software, just open the BIMsage-Jar directory and start the BIMsage-1.0-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar.
