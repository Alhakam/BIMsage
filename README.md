# BIMsage
BIM-based Multimodel platform for managing existing constructions (prototype)

The main-method to start the application is located in the DOTknow-gui-module in the Main.java Class. When the application is opened, just create an ICDD by creating a new project and selecting an IFC model.

Currently the load-feature is not fully implemented and therefore not available in the prototype.

A fully detailed description / documentation will follow in the future.
